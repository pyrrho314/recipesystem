recipesystem
============

The code in the recipesystem repository is a fork from the Gemini Observatory Python Package, which Gemini has
released under a BSD license.  This version is distributed using the Mozilla Public License v. 2.

At the present time, Novem <sup>*</sup>is generalizing the system so it can be used for other types of data pipelines and data types
besides Gemini's FITS-oriented AstroData object. At the same time, we will be expanding the system with cloud features
(automatic scaling), as well as more general purpose HTML5/Javascript interfaces for system control and monitoring.
