recipesystem
============

The code in the *recipesystem* repository is released under the Mozilla Public License v. 2. The software is derived from the Gemini Observatory Python Package, sans Gemini Specific configuration packages and dependencies. Gemini released this system at ADASS 2013 in Kona, Hawaii, under a BSD license. This version is released under MPL 2. 

At the present time, Novem LLC is generalizing the system for commercial use and using the system to automate its partners' particular data processing pipelines using the recipe model. Key development goals for the immediate future:

* relocation of AstroData source code into the astrodata_FITS configuration package
* general purpose documentation (available documentation is Astronomy Oriented)
* automatic cloud-based scaling, job cooperation
* general purpose HTML5/Javascript interfaces for system control and monitoring
* generic library of numpy and pandas primitives
* expansion of the general purpose Set Reference Data Type
* creation of a project roadmap
