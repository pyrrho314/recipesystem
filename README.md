recipesystem
============

The code in the recipesystem repository is a fork from the Gemini Observatory Python Package, which Gemini has
released under a BSD license.  This version is distributed using the Mozilla Public License v. 2.

Currently Novem, llc, is generalizing the system so it can be used for other types of data pipelines and data types
besides Gemini's FITS-oriented AstroData object. At the same time, we will be expanding the system with cloud features
(automatic scaling), as well as more general purpose HTML5/Javascript interfaces for system control and monitoring.
