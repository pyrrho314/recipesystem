Introduction to Astrodata
=========================

Astrodata is a module  in Python designed to handle sets of 
astronomical data as a single unit. Currently Astrodata only supports 
data in Multi-extension FITS files (MEF) coming from the Gemini instruments.
The goal is to provide an interface for the non-professional programmer to easily
access FITS header values and data in a way that is non instrument dependent.

Intended Audience
=================

If you have not seen Python  you could start with Example 1 for an introductory 
examples of Astrodata usage.

If you know IDL already, then you could quickly become familiar with Python as the
syntax is very similar, with a noticeable exception that Python does not use 
curly braces nor 'begin' or 'end' but rather relies on blocks of statements.

Required software
=================

To use this tutorial you need some modules that are part of the default Python
distribution: the Astrodata module is available internaly via the Gemini DPD group;
the Numpy module is also needed for numerical array calculation and it might
be part of your Python installation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
     
This is an interactive Python session with separate commands that give
you results right at the terminal.

   # Starting PYTHON in unix and MacOS.
   #
   # Astrodata module needs to be visible to Python via the
   # unix environment variable PYTHONPATH. Please append a 
   # pathname to this variable where Astrodata is located in 
   # your machine.
   #
   # Example: setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/user/soft/astrodata
   #
   # Now start 'ipython', (a better python shell) and try these commands.

2.  Example 2: Getting information from list of GEMINI FITS file
----------------------------------------------------------------------


This example is a Python script written into a text file which you 
can run at the Unix prompt or as a single command in the Python Shell.


**Running from Unix**

     Notice that this file contains one function called 'list_info' and that the
     first line is '#! /usr/bin/env python' telling the UNIX system to use the
     Python interpreter to execute the rest of the script. This happens when you
     type 'list_FITS_info.py' at the unix prompt.

     The file needs to have executable mode::

        chmod u+x list_FITS_info.py

     To run 'list_FITS_info.py' simply type::

        list_FITS_info.py
        
        or equivalently

        python list_FITS_info.py    # you do not need execute mode in this case


**Running from the Python Shell**

- Assuming you are where 'list_FITS_info.py' is located.

- Tell Python that you have a file (list_FITS_info.py) with a function
  'list_info'::

     from list_FITS_info import list_info       

     # now run the script:

     list_info()             # The scripts does not have arguments, but you need
                             # the parentheses. 

**list_FITS_info.py**. Copy and paste into a file called 'list_FITS_info.py'::
 
    #! /usr/bin/env python

    from astrodata import AstroData
    import glob

    def list_info():

        # Generates a list of FITS files in directory '/data2/rtf_data'
        filelist = glob.glob('/data2/rtf_data/*.fits')
       
        # Placeholder information for the fields to be output
        print 'nsciext: camera: exptime: filtername: instrument: object: ut'

        for file in filelist:         # Loop over all the items in filelist.

            ad = AstroData(file)      # Open the current file

            # Get information for files that are type 'NIRI' and 'GMOS' only.

            if not ad.isType('NIRI') and not ad.isType('GMOS'):
               continue               # Skip to next file in filelist is not
                                      # NIRI nor GMOS

            print '****** ',file

            nxts = ad.countExts('SCI')       # Get number of FITS Science extensions
                                             
            print ad.getTypes()              # show the Astrodata types associated
                                             # with this FITS file and its current
                                             # processing state.
           
            print ad.camera()                # Show the value of the PHU keyword 'CAMERA'
       
            print ad.ad.exposure_time()               # This is the actual EXPTIME*NCOADDS value

            print ad.filter_name()            # Filtername is a unique string discribing 
                                             # the filter for the instrument. 
                                        
            print ad.instrument(), ad.object(), ad.ut_date()    # Header keyword values

            if ad.isType('GMOS'):
                if nxts > 0:
                    print "GAIN:", ad.gain(asList=True)    # print a list of gains
                # Based on the value of the PHU keywords MASKTYPE, MASKNAME
                # and GRATING, the followinf values can be inferred:
                # IMAGE, IFU, LONGSLIST or  MOS.
                print "OBSMODE:", ad.observation_mode(),'\n'

            if ad.isType('NIRI'):
                print 'NIRI FILTER header keywords:',\
                # this next form is a Python 'list comprehension' syntax. It is
                # a compressed 'for loop'.
                [(ff+'='+ad.getPHUHeader()[ff]) for ff in ad.rePHUKeys('FILTER\w*')]
                print 'From niri.descriptor:', ad.filter_name()

4. Line by line explanation of Example 3
----------------------------------------

**Line 1:  #! /usr/bin/env python**

    If you want to run the Python script as a Unix command, this statement
    tells the UNIX shell that indeed is a Python program and loads the
    interpreter.


**Line 3:  import astrodata as ad**
           from astrodata.AstroData import prepOutput

 Python modules that are not part of the default installation 
 need to be loaded using some of these constructions. 
 'import astrodata as ad': Will look at the directory 
 'astrodata' and executes the file '__init__.py' creating a shorter name
 'ad' as an alias.
 'from astrodata.AstroData import prepOutput' will load the module 
 'AstroData.py' and loads the function  'prepOutput'
 The pathname to this directory needs to be accessible
 via the environment variable PYTHONPATH.


**Line 7:  def ADUToElectron(filelist, outprefix, verbose)**

 This is the function definition, its name is 'ADUToElectron'. 
 When calling it you must give the one or more filenames in a list
 and the output prefix for the output files as a string, verbose is a
 True/ False argument. 


**Line 14:   for filename in filelist:**
 
 The first line is a DO loop statement. It will take each
 element of 'filelist' and put the value in 'filename'.

**Line 17:  adinput = ad.AstroData(file, mode='readonly')**

 We use the function 'AstroData()' from the module 'AstroData.py'
 that was loaded when we imported in Line 3.
 This is the starting point of the 'astrodata' usage. We are opening
 a file and returning a list of Astrodata (iterable) and functions. To see
 a list of these functions please type 'dir adinput' in your Python shell. For help
 on any: 'help adinput.phuValue'

**Line 20: if adinput.phuValue('ELECTRON') != None:**

 This function looks for the value of the PHU (primary header unit) keyword 'ELECTRON';
 if there is no such keyword, it returns the value 'None'.

**Line 35: adout = prepOutput(adinput, outputname)**

 This function returns an AstroData object with the PHU of the input 
 file. The output filename will be 'outputname'.

**Line 40: gain = ad.gain(asList=True)**

 The fits file openned has gain information in each of the EHUs (extension header
 unit). This command returns a python list with those values. 
 It assumes that the keyword name is 'GAIN'.

**Line 47: adc = deepcopy(adinput)**

 Make a new copy of the input Astrodata object; we do not want to 
 change the input data in memory.

**Line 48: for extension,g,xn in zip(adinput, gain, range(len(gain))):**

 This is a compound Do loop statement of the form 'for VARS in LIST'.
 The 'zip' function takes as arguments one or more Python lists and
 returns a list of tuples, with one element at a time. For example:
 zip([1,2],['a','b']), returns [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]. The function 'range(n)'
 takes an integer and expands it into an increasing sequence from 0..n-1.
  
 The VARS will then contain one set of tuples at a time.

**Line 49:   extension.data = extension.data * g**

 'extension' is a python  object containing the pixel area data among other things.
 we just replace those values with the new ones. This is a memory operation
 and does not affect the input file.

**Line 50:   adout.append(data=extension.data, header=extension.header)**

 We now append a new FITS extension to the output file with its data and header.

**Line 53: adout.phuSetKeyValue('ELECTRON', fits_utc(), \\**
           **comment='UT Modified with convertToElectrons')**

 Appends the indicated keyword to the PHU; its value is the value of the function
 'fits_utc()' defined at the end of the Example. Notice that Python
 allows for a statement to be broken in different lines; mostly a 
 comma is a good line separator.

**Line 57: adout.write()**

 Writes to disk the updated output AstroData object. The filename was already
 defined in 'prepOutput()'
