The gmos_ifu_data.py currently (2013-05-23) only contains information for GMOS-N
EEV CCDs. A slight offset for the e2vDD CCDs is required (iirc - see GACQ for
details). I'm not sure if it works for e2vDDs out of the box - there may be some
image processing required. For example, overscan correction, trimming and
tiling (into CCDs or into the entire detector?).

Information for GMOS-S EEV is required.

Eventually we'll need information for the Hamamatsu CCDs. Assuming and image
processing that is required for the e2vDD CCDs is done using the recipe system
then the image processing required for the Hamamatsu CCDs will be handled there
and should only require an update of the gmos_ifu_data.py (or similar) to
define the location of the fibers.
