Recipe and Primitive Tutorial
=============================

For the sample data we are going to use US Census 2012 County Business patterns data, "Complete Metropolitcan Area File"
which is 7.6MB compressed and about 63MB uncompressed. It's a comma separated text file. The file we are looking for is at [http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/download/](County Business Patterns). We are using the "complete Metropolitan Area File" from 2012. Data all the way back to 1986 is available, and up to 2013 at the time of this writing.
